    <h2> Chronomancer </h2>
    <p> Inspired by the likes of Cave Story and Hollow Knight, Chronomancer is an action metroidvania where you are sent to an alien world to search for your lost brother, a soldier sent to assist the inhabitants.
      Upon your arrival, you find the planet has been overun by a creeping, vile corruption, spreading like weeds, infecting the inhabitants of this once glorious world.
      What once were innocent creatures are ravaged by hunger and bloodlust, and you seem to be a fine meal. Your brother was a solider - he was equipped for this. You are not.
      Armed with just a scythe, you must use your species' power to manipulate time to keep yourself alive, and find your brother again.</p>

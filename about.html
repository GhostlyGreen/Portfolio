    <h2> Games! </h2>
      <p>I'm currently working on two solo games, Lysis and Chronomancer (Read more about them in the Projects section!)</p>
      <p>Lysis is a action rouguelike where you take the role of a bacterial cell, fighting the immune system</p>
      <p>Chronomancer is an action metriodvania, with an emphasis on manipulating time to gain the upper hand</p>
      <p>I am also a developer for a group project, Bread Quest, a platformer. </p>
      <p>I have worked with python, C++, HTML, and Gdscript. These projects are all made in GDscript, with the godot game engine.</p>

    <h2> Music </h2>
    <p> I also write the soundtrack to both the solo projects mentioned above. </p>
    <p> I have been writing music for ~3 years (as of 6/7/26), and mainly work with orchestral and symphonic metal</p>
    <p> I originally started writing music in musescore for fun, but eventually switched to FL Studio as tracks got increasingly more complex</p>
    <p> Currently, I have produced (# of songs goes here), with many more to come. </p>

    <h2> Music </h2>
    <p> I also write the soundtrack to both the solo projects mentioned above. </p>
    <p> I have been writing music for ~3 years (as of 6/7/26), and mainly work with orchestral and symphonic metal</p>
    <p> I originally started writing music in musescore for fun, but eventually switched to FL Studio as tracks got increasingly more complex.</p>
    <p> I have released many remixes, and have been working on original music and soundtracks for 2 years.</p>
